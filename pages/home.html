            <h1>500 Miles For Parkinson's</h1>

            <p>In the spring of 2016, Harry McMurtry will walk from New York City to his hometown, Toronto, to raise money for Parkinson&rsquo;s research. He will be accompanied on the walk by Sue Thompson of Toronto and Dr. Ross Sugar of Baltimore, MD. As Harry, Sue and Ross all have Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, walking a half-marathon a day for 45 days is a tremendous challenge and one that makes this event a much bigger story about the disease itself.&nbsp; The walk will be bookended by two other events &ndash; a launch event in New York City and a wrap event in Toronto.&nbsp; The walk is intended to bridge two great cities and two great countries in an effort to fight - and bring awareness to - a common foe, namely, Parkinson's disease.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The financial goal of&nbsp;<em>500 Miles for Parkinson's&nbsp;</em>is to raise $500,000 for Parkinson's research.&nbsp; The proceeds&nbsp;will be pooled and divided amongst three beneficiaries:</p>
