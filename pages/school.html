            <h1>School Program</h1>
            <p>One of the goals of 500 Miles for Parkinson's is to raise awareness of Parkinson's disease. To help achieve this goal, we want to engage school-aged children and, thus, their schools in the project. This engagement may be accomplished in at least two ways:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Schools may invite Harry to address the school about Parkinson's disease generally or 500 Miles specifically</li>

                <li>Schools may buy a mile through student fundraising activities.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>School Visits</h2>

            <p>Harry will attend schools along the walk route to briefly address either a school assembly or an individual class.  He will put a face to Parkinson's disease; he will discuss the disease in simple terms; and he will emphasize that people with disabilities lead fulfilling lives.</p>

            <p>Harry will be available at the beginning of the school day.</p>

            <h2>Buy a Mile</h2>

            <p>We believe that one is never too young to learn the value of charitable giving. Furthermore, 100% of the money raised by schools will be donated to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.</p>

            <p>There is no minimum requirement to buy a mile; all monies will be gratefully received.  However, the school that raises the most amount will receive a prize [TBD].</p>

            <p>If your school is located on or near Harry's route and you are interested in getting involved with 500 Miles for Parkinson's, then please contact us.</p>
